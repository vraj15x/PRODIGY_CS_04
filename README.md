Description
The Keylogger is a Python-based tool designed to log keystrokes on a computer system covertly. It captures keystrokes from the keyboard input and records them to a file or transmits them to a remote server.

Note: Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes like monitoring children's internet activities or employee computer usage with proper consent. However, deploying keyloggers without authorization is illegal and unethical.

Features
Keystroke Logging: Records all keystrokes typed on the keyboard.
Stealth Mode: Operates silently in the background without user detection.
Persistence: Automatically starts capturing keystrokes upon system startup.
Data Storage: Saves logged keystrokes locally or transmits them to a remote server (if applicable).
Security Considerations
Legal and Ethical Use: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Use the keylogger responsibly and with proper authorization.
Data Privacy: Handle logged data securely and consider encryption for transmission over networks.
Detection: Be aware that antivirus programs and security software may detect and flag keyloggers as malicious software
